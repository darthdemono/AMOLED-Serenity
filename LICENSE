                      Version 1.0

This is a simple license that allows you to do whatever you want with this code, as long as you remember to buy me a beer if we ever meet.

**1. You are free to:**
    - Use, modify, and distribute this code as you wish, in any medium, for any purpose.
    - Make commercial use of this code, as long as you keep this license intact.

**2. However, if we meet someday:**
    - You are encouraged (but not obligated) to buy me a beer in return for this software. 
    - This license does not cover any legal liability; use at your own risk.

**3. Disclaimer:**
    - This software is provided "as-is," without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. 
    - I am not responsible for any damages or issues that may arise from the use of this software.

Enjoy the code, and remember to stay hydrated!
